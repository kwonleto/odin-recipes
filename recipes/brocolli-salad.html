    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple broccoli salad kicks up ordinary broccoli with some lemon and red pepper flakes.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds fresh broccoli</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, mashed into a paste</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim bottoms of broccoli stems and cut off broccoli heads; cut the broccoli heads into quarters. Peel broccoli stems and cut into quarters crosswise.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook broccoli until tender when cut with a paring knife but still slightly firm, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Transfer broccoli to a large bowl filled with cold water and chill to stop the cooking process. Drain well. Arrange broccoli in a colander with the florets facing down towards the holes of the colander and allow broccoli to drip for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Whisk together garlic, lemon juice, rice vinegar, Dijon mustard, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper together in a large serving bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil while whisking rapidly until the dressing is thick and creamy. Adjust salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes to taste.</li>
            
        <li>Toss broccoli with the dressing; let stand 5 to 10 minutes to marinate, then toss again. Can be refrigerated up to an hour if you want to serve the salad cold.</li>
            
    </ol>
